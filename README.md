# Forecasting Apple Stock Price

**Project Description**

This is a repository for my final project for Introduction to Data Science at UCLA Extension, class of Spring 2021.

The US stock market has seen a huge influx of retail investors and traders over the past year, especially over the past couple months following the Gamestop/hedge fund saga. As one of these new investors, I was interested in whether I could forecast stock prices for my own investment purposes.

Machine learning is the core basis of “algo trading” as people call it these days. Entire financial institutions are built around these predictions that incorporate transaction data and technical analysis indicators to inform the optimal prices and times to buy and sell securities. One example is the brokerage app Robinhood which is extremely popular amongst retail investors—this company collects all the transaction from its users and sells it to Citadel and other market makers. This information is incredibly insightful as these money markets can harness this data to more properly analyze momentum & sentiment, as well as better anticipate investors’ next trades.
